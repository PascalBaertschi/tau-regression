Access to PSI CmsTier3 is required to get the inputs for the neural network and SVfit

## Running training and evaluation

Run [nn_github.py](nn_github.py) in virtualenv with pandas, tensorflow and keras installed (GPU is recommended):

If not yet done, install miniconda following the instructions, no changes to default arguments:

```shell
wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
sh Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Then create the virtualenv with the required packages:

```shell
conda create --name=taureg python=2 keras tensorflow pandas scikit-learn
source activate taureg
```

Run `python nn_github.py`.

Keras uses tensorflow or theano as backend. The backend can be changed in the file `$HOME/.keras/keras.json`.

## Running SVfit

Running SVfit is only recommended if there is access to 10 or more CPU cores.

Setup:
```shell
cmsrel CMSSW_8_0_23
cd CMSSW_8_0_23/src
cmsenv
``` 
Clone the repository from Clemens Lange and change to the SVfit_standalone directory:
`git clone https://github.com/clelange/SVfit_standalone.git`

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../svFit
make -j4
make test ARGS="--output-on-failure"
make install
````

Now you should have the shared library libSVfitStandaloneAlgorithm.so and dictionary in the ../svFit directory. To be able to load the library, you need to extend the LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Run from the build directory:

`export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${PWD}/../svFit/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}`

This export is needed whenever you open a new shell.

`run [svfit_github.py](svfit_github.py)` in `CMSSW_8_0_23`.


## Plots

Run `[nnplots_github.py](nnplots_github.py)` in `CMSSW_8_0_23`
